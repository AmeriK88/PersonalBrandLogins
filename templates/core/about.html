                <h2 class="about-subtitle mb-3">A journey of faith, resilience, and leadership</h2>

                <p class="mb-3">
                    Greg’s story began in <strong>Sodus High School</strong>, where he led the Spartans to a perfect <strong>27–0 record</strong> 
                    and a <strong>New York State Championship</strong> in 2005. He was named <strong>State MVP</strong> and set records that still stand today —
                    including a 25-rebound performance in the Rochester McDonald’s All-Star Game.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                    After a post-graduate year at Kent School, Greg earned a scholarship to <strong>Canisius College</strong>, where he became 
                    a <strong>three-time team captain</strong>, scoring <strong>1,200+ points</strong> and grabbing <strong>750+ rebounds</strong>.
                    Beyond stats, he proved that academics and athletics could go hand in hand — completing both a 
                    <strong>Bachelor’s in Physical Education & Health</strong> and a <strong>Master’s in Sports Administration</strong>.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                    His professional career has been global: Mexico, Morocco, Finland, Japan, Israel, Germany, Argentina, Denmark, and Luxembourg. 
                    From playoff runs to all-league selections, Greg became known for his consistency, leadership, and adaptability — 
                    a true student of the game wherever he played.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote mb-3">
                    “They said I’d never play again. I said, ‘They don’t know me.’”
                </blockquote>

                <p class="mb-3">
                    In 2019, a devastating knee injury threatened to end it all. But Greg’s faith and discipline turned pain into purpose.
                    After surgery and months of relentless rehab, he made a full comeback — only to face another major injury in 2022.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                    When doctors said he’d never walk or run normally again, he smiled and replied, <strong>“Watch this.”</strong>
                    Months later, he returned to the court, proving that mindset, not circumstance, defines the limits of possibility.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-0">
                    Today, Greg continues to play and mentor, using his journey to inspire athletes, students, and dreamers worldwide. 
                    His message is simple: <strong>Faith, focus, and effort will always beat the odds.</strong>

                    <p class="small mb-2">
                        <em>“In 2019, I tore my patella tendon. They told me I’d never play again. But I believed otherwise.”</em>
                    </p>
                    <p class="small mb-2">
                        After two knee surgeries — one in Germany, one in Luxembourg — Greg redefined recovery through faith and discipline.
                        Each time, he returned stronger, faster, and more focused than before.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small mb-0">
                        <strong>“Two knees. Two comebacks. One unbreakable mindset.”</strong><br>
                        When someone says “You can’t,” Greg just smiles and says, <strong>“Watch this.”</strong>
